One of the goals of this page is to determine how to develop a webpage that can host thousands of concurrent connections on a lightweight System on a chip, such as a raspberry Pi.

"https://web.archive.org/web/20070118063239/http://www.sics.se/~joe/apachevsyaws.html "Machine 2 requests 20 KByte pages from machine 1. It does this in tight a loop requesting a new page as soon as it has received a page from the server." 

I built a webpage less than 500 bytes. I haven't hosted it yet, but the html code is in the files section here. Ideally, it would be used to host a BBS=-like system, but with additional features.
